<h4>Jordan’s new residue norms</h4>



<p>Monday, 9 April 2018</p>



<p>We were in the dark about Jordan’s new residue norms, claims rice exporters body </p>



<p>The All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA) on Thursday said it has taken up the issue of Jordan rejecting rice containers of an Indian exporter early this week with agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda) and Jordan Chamber of Commerce. Jordan’s Agriculture Ministry has denied permission for offloading 12 containers carrying 270 tonnes of basmati rice from a North Indian exporter at its Aqaba port as Jordanian government laboratories found the pesticide residue in rice samples examined were higher than the maximum residue level (MRL). “The samples were found to have residue level (of fungicide tricyclazole) higher than it is now permitted. However, what is strange was that Jordan did not notify its decision to revise MRL and as a result, this information was not publicly available,” said AIREA Executive Director Rajen Sundaresan.<strong>EU norms</strong><br> “All of a sudden, Jordan has decided to adopt the European Union (EU) norms for tricyclazole residue, which stands at 0.01 parts per million (ppm). We had little knowledge about this,” he said, adding that the association has already written to Apeda and Jordan Chamber of Commerce. From January 1 this year, the EU decided to not allow the import of basmati rice whose tricyclazole levels exceed more than 0.01 ppm to its member countries, affecting most basmati exporters from India. Prior to the implementation of new norms, the MRL in Indian basmati was 1 ppm. The tolerance levels for tricyclazole in the US and Japan, interestingly, are much higher, at 3 ppm and 10 ppm respectively. Indian rice exporters have been lobbying with the Central government for getting the new norms relaxed by the EU for two years.&nbsp;<strong>Options left</strong><br> Sundaresan, who refused to name the exporter whose consignment has been blocked, said the options available to them include bringing the consignment back to India, or destroying it or re-routing the shipment to the countries where such MRL is permitted.<br> “The tricyclazole levels permitted in India is 3 ppm. When the consignment left India it was within the permissible limits. But Jordan has suddenly decided to follow the EU regime. We have written to them to find out since when it has come into effect,” the AIREA official said.</p>

<h4>Monday, 16 July 2018</h4>



<p>A 13 per cent increase in MSP of paddy has sent jitters among the
non-basmati rice exporters, who fear that the price rise will make
the Indian cereal unviable in the global market and threaten India’s
position as the largest exporter of rice, they said.&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;While
we welcome the increase in MSP for farmers, the government should
also look at sustaining the growth in rice exports,&#8221;</strong>&nbsp;said
BV Krishna Rao, President of the Rice Exporters Association.</p>



<p><strong>Govt incentives</strong></p>



<p>The government could look at incentivesthrough schemes such as
Merchandise Exports from India Scheme or interest subvention, he
added. The rice exporters are planning to take up the issue with the
Commerce Ministry soon.</p>



<p><strong>Non-basmati shipments</strong></p>



<p>Non-basmati rice shipments have emerged as a major component of
the Indian farm produce exports in recent years helping the country
to emerge as the largest exporter of the cereal. Non-basmati rice
exports stood at 8.6 million tonnes (mt) valued at $3 billion last
year. In the current, financial year, the shipments have maintained
the growth trend with a weakening rupee aiding the exports. As per
the latest data from Apeda, non-basmati rice shipments have grown 40
per cent in the first two months of current, financial year at 1.43
mt valued at $603 million ( Rs. 4,013 crore) over the corresponding
last year. The non-basmati rice accounts for around a fifth of the
Apeda’s export basket in value terms.</p>



<p><strong>Export markets</strong></p>



<p>Of India’s total rice production of
108 mt, the domestic consumption including the buffer stocks is
estimated at around 97-98 mt, while the rest is exported mainly to
countries in Africa, Bangladesh and SriLanka. Any slow-down in
shipments will lead to accumulation of stocks and may influence the
prices, the exporters said.</p>

<h4>Monday, 3 September 2018</h4>



<p>
Riding
on a near normal monsoon, output of most food crops is projected to
hit record levels in 2017-18 to give an all-time high foodgrain
harvest of 284.83 million tonnes, 3.5 per cent higher than that of
the previous year, according to the 4th advance estimates released on
Tuesday.<br>
Rice production is expected to touch a peak of 112.91
mt, 3 per cent more than last year’s, while wheat will just fall
shy of the 100-mt mark, the data released by the Agriculture Ministry
showed.<br>
Pulses production, on the other hand, is seen crossing
25 mt, despite a substantial fall expected in tur production. The
record increase expected in urad and gram will compensate for the tur
shortfall.<br>
Despite an anticipated 17 per cent drop in soybean
output to 10.98 mt, total oilseeds production is projected to be
similar to that of the previous year, at 31.31 mt, thanks to an
impressive recovery expected in groundnut output at 9.18 mt, nearly
23 per cent higher than the 7.46 mt in 2016-17.
The
production of coarse cereals too is expected to climb to a new high
of 46.99 mt, up 3.22 mt from 2016-17, despite bajra yields being
projected to slide 5 per cent.<br>
A record 20 per cent increase in
sugarcane production in 2017-18 to 376.9 mt has already precipitated
a severe crisis in the sugar sector, requiring the government to
intervene so that the sugarcane farmers, whose dues from sugar mills
have mounted, get some reprieve. Cotton output, too, is projected to
go up by more than 2 million bales (of 170 kg each) to 34.89 million
bales, according to the official data.<br>
The estimated maize
output will be 28.72 mt, which is nearly 3 mt more than the final
production in 2016-17.</p>

<h4>Saturday, 27 October 2018</h4>



<p><strong>Rising demand also behind rise in price</strong>&nbsp;<em>KOLKATA,
OCTOBER 25</em></p>



<p>Basmati paddy prices have firmed up by
25-30 per cent on the back of speculation of a drop in production and
firm demand both in domestic and export markets. The price of the
premium Pusa 1121 variety of basmati paddy is presently ruling at
around Rs. 3,700 a quintal, as against Rs. 2,800 a quintal during the
same period last year, recording a rise of nearly 32 percent. The
price of Pusa 1509 is also up by 29 per cent at Rs. 3,100 a quintal.
Harvesting of basmati paddy, primarily cultivated in Punjab and
Haryana, starts in October and continues till December.</p>



<p>&#8220;As per satellite data the area
under basmati paddy cultivation is down by 2-3 per cent this year and
the carry-forward stock from last year is also low. This, coupled
with a firm demand for exports, has helped push up prices,&#8221;
Vijay Sethia, President, All India Rice Exporters’ Association
(AIREA), told BusinessLine. While the area under paddy cultivation is
slightly lower this year, the yield is better because there has been
a shift to Pusa 1509, a high-yielding variety that produces close to
24-28 quintal an acre, as compared to Pusa 1121, which yields 18-22
quintal an acre. The country produces close to 9 lakh tonnes of
basmati paddy each year, from which nearly six lakh tonnes of rice is
produced. According to Suraj Agarwal, CEO, Tirupati Agri Trade,
unseasonal and heavy rains in the months of August and September have
affected the standing crop marginally, which may have an impact on
production.</p>



<p>However, the rise in prices is more on
account of a strong demand from overseas markets. Typically there is
a dip in price when the new crop begins to arrive in2 the market;
however, prices have increased in the last 15-20 days, sources said.
Pusa 1509 has moved up by nearly 19 per cent from Rs. 2,600 a quintal
and Pusa 1121 by close to 9 per cent from Rs. 3,400 a quintal just
about 20 days ago. “Production is almost similar to last year; the
price rise is more due to speculation of a possible dip in
production,” said Gurnam Arora, Joint Managing Director, Kohinoor
Foods. Rice prices firm up Firming up of paddy prices over the last
two procurement seasons coupled with a strong demand from overseas
markets, particularly Iran, has helped boost average realisation of
basmati rice. The price of basmati rice has increased by nearly 12
per cent to Rs. 73,000 a tonne this year, as compared to Rs. 65,000 a
tonne last year. In the period from April to August of the current
fiscal, India exported close to 1.85 million tonnes of basmati rice
valued at Rs. 13,629 crore. The country exported over four million
tonnes of basmati rice valued at around Rs. 26,870 crore in FY’18.
Iran and Saudi Arabia together account for nearly 50 per cent of
imports.</p>



<p>“In the first four months of the
current fiscal year, Iran has already imported close to 70 per cent
of its previous fiscal’s total basmati rice imports from India,”
said Deepak Jotwani, assistant Vice-President, ICRA. AIREA along with
APEDA and the Punjab government, has also been taking several
initiatives to boost exports to the US and Europe by educating
farmers against pesticide use. It is to be noted that several export
consignments of basmati were rejected by the US and the EU because of
high pesticide residue last year. Saudi Arabia has also been
following the European Union by tightening pesticide residue
parameters.</p>

<h4>Monday, 26 November 2018</h4>



<p><strong>Non-basmati shipments to get subsidy from Nov 26 to March 25</strong></p>



<p>As a 13 per cent increase in minimum
support price (MSP) for paddy slows down India’s rice exports in
the current financial year, the Centre has announced incentive to
boost the shipments of the cereal. The non-basmati rice exports will
get a 5 per cent subsidy under the Merchandise Exports from India
Scheme (MEIS) from November 26 till March 25, 2019, a Commerce
Ministry note said. The Centre’s latest move to subsidise the
non-basmati rice shipments for the first time since exports were
opened up in 2011 assumes significance as the country is headed for a
record harvest of rice, pegged at 99.24 million tonnes by the
Agriculture Ministry in its first advance estimates.Also, the rice
stocks in the Central pool as on November 1 stood at 16.25 mt, over
60 per cent higher than the buffer norms.</p>



<p>The harvest of paddy has already commenced in several States and
the state agencies led by Food Corporation of India have already
started the procurement of the cereal. “The 5 per cent incentive
under MEIS will definitely enhance our competitiveness in the world
market,” said BV Krishna Rao, President of the Rice Exporters
Association, a trade body of non-basmati rice millers and exporters.
The subsidy coupled with a weak currency would help us offset the
impact of the MSP on exports and cover the shortfall in shipments,
Rao said. The Centre had increased the MSP for paddy by ₹200 per
quintal at ₹1,750 per quintal for common variety and ₹1,770 for
Grade A.</p>



<p><strong>Slowing exports</strong></p>



<p>Indian’s non-basmati rice exports
have slowed down during the past couple of months and exporters said
the hike in MSP had hit their competitiveness in the world market
thereby impacting the exports. In the first half of the current
financial year, the shipments were down at 3.72 mt (4.28 mt in
corresponding last year) valued at $1.59 billion ($1.74 billion). The
opening up of non-basmati exports in 2011 has helped India emerge the
largest rice exporter for past several years. Major markets for the
non-basmati rice are the African and Asian countries. India, which
ships out over 12 mt of rice, now accounts for over a fourth of the
annual global rice trade estimated at around 47 mt by the Food and
Agricultural Organisation. India competes with Vietnam, Thailand and
Pakistan in the world rice market.</p>



<p>India’s total rice production during
2017-18 stood at 112.91 mt and the government is targeting 113 mt
this year. The FAO in its recent biannual Food Outlook has forecast
that global rice production is set to increase by 1.3 per cent to a
new high of 513 mt this year and India would be spearheading the
growth in production.</p>

<h4>Sunday, 20 January 2019</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://riceofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7333" srcset="https://riceofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1.png 320w, https://riceofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>India has been the world’s top rice exporter since the
beginning of this decade. But this boom has benefited only merchant
capitalists, not consumers and producers</strong></p>



<p>India emerged the world’s largest
rice exporter in 2011-12, displacing Thailand from its leadership
position. Two factors played a role in this. The first was the
government’s decision in February 2011 to lift a four-year ban on
exports of non-basmati varieties of rice, paving the way for a rise
in exports of those varieties. The second was a decision of the then
Thai government under Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, taken in
the same year, to favour farmers by strengthening a Rice Pledging
Scheme under which it promised to procure unlimited stocks at an
enhanced price that reflected a 50 per cent increase over 2010. The
consequent increase in domestic prices obviously reduced the
incentive to sell in export markets rather than to the government or
in the local market. India was a major beneficiary, recording a sharp
increase in exports of non-basmati varieties. As opposed to exports
of around 1,00,000 tonnes of The dynamics of India’s rice export
boom &#8211; &#8211; The Hindu BusinessLine those varieties in 2010-11, exports
soared to 4 million tonnes in 2011-12. Exports of basmati rice in
those two years stood at 2.3 and 3.2 million tonnes respectively
(Chart 1).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xFEgUGq-Dwg/XEQm-gCMZAI/AAAAAAAAAVA/mxSNM_4i6E8DC9lpKRbgTQsmoWQ77BtJACLcBGAs/s320/news2.jpg" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p><strong>Non-basmati surge</strong></p>



<p>Given the circumstances, the Indian
rise to dominance in global rice markets is explained without much
difficulty. What is striking, however, is the continuous increase in
exports of non-basmati varieties since then, to 8.2 million tonnes in
2014-15, and after a fall to 6.4 million tonnes in the subsequent
year, a rise again to 8.6 million tonnes in 2017-18. The result has
been that despite the significant price difference between basmati
and non-basmati rice varieties, the difference in foreign exchange
earned from exports of these varieties has narrowed considerably
(Chart 2).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1EG2kqlrQLs/XEQns0m6nuI/AAAAAAAAAVI/KZJM7Y_A93kLXVXoJJIo2P2OSBi7vs4UQCLcBGAs/s320/news3.jpg" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>The increase in non-basmati exports
occurred despite the fact that the enhanced pledging scheme in
Thailand was suspended in early 2014, that production in India did
not rise much till 2016-17, having fluctuated between 104 and 107
million tonnes between 2011-12 and 2015-16, before rising to 110 and
113 million tonnes in the next two years, and that Vietnam has been a
third important player in world markets. India’s share in world
exports in recent years (2014-18) has stayed at 25-26 per cent,
Thailand’s has fluctuated between 22 and 25 per cent, and Vietnam’s
between 13 and 16 per cent. As a result, the exports to production
ratio for rice in India rose from 2.4 per cent in 2009-10 to 6.8 per
cent in 2011-12 and 9.6 per cent in 2012-13, after which it has
fluctuated between 9.9 and 11.3 per cent. In normal circumstances,
this should have resulted in a degree of price buoyancy in domestic
markets, and discouraged exports. But the incentive to export seems
to have remained high and persistent.</p>



<p>What this suggests is that over a
relatively long period domestic demand for rice has remained below
domestic availability, even after taking rising export ratios into
account. This is surprising, because procurement introduces an
‘exogenous’ player in the form of the government into the market.
Government procurement fluctuated between 32 and 35 million tonnes
between 2011-12 and 2015-16, before rising to 38 million tonnes in
the following two years when production was also rising.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AkWwcKKd6Ew/XEQomGvkZCI/AAAAAAAAAVU/KENd_ZEu9X4q-i5hlTM65agWFW-SXwSnQCLcBGAs/s320/news4.jpg" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>The minimum support price (MSP)
(adjusted for the paddy to rice conversion) at which rice was
procured by the government, presumably setting a floor to market
prices, rose over time but remained consistently below the export
price for Grade A rice from India until mid-2015 (Chart 3). The
recent sharper rise in MSP has more or less brought it to par. So
rather than the procurement price, it may be the quantum of
procurement that has been kept at levels that have not affected the
incentive to export rice.</p>



<p>This limited effect of procurement on
the incentive to export is reflected in the relationship between the
export price and wholesale prices in three metro cities, for example.
As Chart 4 shows, wholesale prices have more or less matched the
export price in Delhi and Mumbai, though the wholesale price in
Chennai is afflicted by unusual volatility that needs a separate
explanation. Going by this trend, it appears that after non-basmati
exports were liberalised, the international price has set the range
of domestic prices, resulting in an implicit calibration of domestic
prices with border prices.</p>



<p><strong>Subdued domestic demand</strong></p>



<p>Once again this suggests that domestic
demand for rice has remained below domestic availability, despite the
rising share of exports to domestic production. This subdued demand
hits farmers, who find cultivation increasingly unviable despite
rising rice exports.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-68H9zI2xjnQ/XEQp9ctzugI/AAAAAAAAAVo/GcBgFxJiKEMAqiC_FMOnd7SIsNn-TXdvACLcBGAs/s320/news6.jpg" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>Moreover, the benefit of a
“disciplining” international price does not seem to have accrued
to consumers. Retail prices in all metropolitan cities have remained
well above the export price (Chart 5), showing high and rising
distribution margins. So the liberalisation of the rice trade seems
to have benefited only one section, the merchant capitalists, and not
the actual producers or consumers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xXirErC7JLY/XEQqPYjLeoI/AAAAAAAAAVw/57rxvDzilSA_9VXv1aJgwJVPKNrH2XZiACLcBGAs/s320/news11.jpg" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p><strong>The oil import bill is just one of the factors responsible for
the rising trade de cit. Non-oil imports cannot be overlooked</strong></p>



<p>India’s external account has once
again emerged as a source of concern, as the current account deficit
widened to reach 2.4 per cent of GDP over April-June 2018. This
increase was driven entirely by the trade deficit, which grew rapidly
in 2017-18. Since 2014, as Chart 1 shows, exports have been mostly
stagnant (after a period of healthy increases before then) but total
imports came down and then increased sharply in 2017-18. This was
reflected in the total merchandise trade deficit, which declined for
several years from the large deficit observed in 2013-14, and only
rose sharply once again in 2017-18.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2-sLaN85U10/XEQrbckQdEI/AAAAAAAAAV8/CZ4a-IjayN8oji_JUkgwZVGa_mn0CG_6gCLcBGAs/s320/news7.jpg" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>More recently, over the period
April-November 2018, the trade deficit is once again said to have
widened to ₹892 billion, an increase of 30 per cent over the same
period in the previous year.</p>



<p>This timing suggests that global oil
prices have been the significant driver of the total trade deficit.
After all, India is a substantial net importer of oil. Periods of
rising global oil prices have therefore been associated with higher
total imports and when global oil prices fall or stay low, the import
bill comes down correspondingly. So it seems only natural to assume
that the external deficit is really driven by factors outside
domestic policy control, particularly the vagaries of the global oil
market. Indeed, there is no doubt that the Modi regime benefited
hugely from the global decline in oil prices that was so marked in
the first four years of its tenure, which reduced the pressure on the
balance of trade, contributed to lower rates of domestic inflation,
and provided windfall gains to the public coffers as the government
did not pass on most of the oil price decline to consumers but
instead raised tax rates.</p>



<p>However, matters with respect to the
impact of oil prices on the balance of trade are not quite so simple.
To start with, India is both an exporter and an importer of petroleum
products, and the growing involvement of domestic oil refinery and
distribution corporations (particularly the private ones) has made
external trade in oil and oil products quite complicated.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TIfhVXpFIsg/XEQth4cCMhI/AAAAAAAAAWM/HGuAfHAjUGMvcmJ9nZq1GS442LA7EdP4ACLcBGAs/s320/news9.jpg" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>Quite often, increased oil exports
reflect the choices domestic oil companies make to produce for the
domestic market or to export, which in turn are related to the local
prices and duties, therefore driven by domestic policy. Chart 2,
which shows only the oil trade balance, indicates that the oil
deficit can increase even in periods of relatively low global oil
prices (as in 2016-17) precisely because of such choices made by
Indian oil corporations, especially the private players like
Reliance.</p>



<p>What complicates matters further is the
fact that non-oil imports have typically been high and rising
rapidly. Chart 3 shows that even in the mid-2000s, non-oil trade was
largely in balance and then began to show only relatively small
deficits from 2006 onwards. After 2008 such deficits grew rapidly, as
imports kept growing much faster than exports.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5kfsZ77Sv-k/XEQtdXskFkI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/tQXI2vtCyGU_vygd84amyGg0dAEvS5BnwCPcBGAYYCw/s320/news8.jpg" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p><strong>Rapid expansion</strong></p>



<p>The non-oil merchandise trade de cit
peaked in 2012-13, ironically a time when global oil prices were also
not that low. They came down the following year, but then rose once
more, as non-oil imports kept expanding rapidly. It is worth noting
that this increase was driven by increasing import volumes, as prices
for many of India’s imports also remained low. This is an important
point, because it points to the fact that the potential of imports to
displace domestic production has been much greater than is indicated
only by the value of imports.</p>



<p>Indeed, increased imports of a variety
of final goods, both primary and manufactured, have added to the woes
of many small-scale producers in agriculture and industry as they
have kept domestic prices of their output low, sometimes even below
costs. This has also meant that even in the period of rise in oil
prices in 2017-18, the non-oil trade deficit was even larger than the
oil trade deficit. Chart 4 points to an interesting tendency: since
2004, the share of the oil deficit in the total balance of trade
deficit has been coming down continuously, barring the outlier year
of 2013-14 when world oil prices spiked sharply. This has also meant
that even in the period of rise in oil prices in 2017-18, the non-oil
trade deficit was even larger than the oil trade deficit. Chart 4
points to an interesting tendency: since 2004, the share of the oil
deficit in the total balance of trade deficit has been coming down

<p>Indeed, from being 20 per cent more
than the actual trade deficit (because the non-oil balance was in
surplus then) it has fallen to explaining less than half — only 44
per cent of the deficit in 2017-18. So high global oil prices are
only one of the many reasons why India should be concerned about the
rising external trade deficit. The more significant culprits lie
elsewhere, and they cannot be simplistically blamed on global forces
beyond the government’s control.</p>

<h3>Dairy, pulses exports rise, while shipments of buffalo meat,non-basmati rice fall</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://riceofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7325"/></figure></div>



<p>Shipments of basmati rice, the largest
product in the country’s farm-export basket, touched a record high
in volumes and rupee value terms in 2018-19 on account of aggressive
buying by Iran and a weak currency.</p>



<p>Volumes grew by about a tenth to over
4.41 million tonnes (mt) over the previous year, while the export
value, in rupee terms, grew 22 per cent to touch Rs. 32,806 crore.</p>



<p>In dollar terms, basmati exports went
up by 13 per cent to $4.71 billion — the second highest since
2013-14, when it touched a record $4.88 billion.</p>



<p>AK Gupta, Director, Basmati Export
Development Foundation, attributed the record shipments to robust
purchases by Iran.</p>



<p>“There was some good demand from Iran
after a couple of years. Iran purchased over 1.4 million tonnes
during the year,” Gupta said.</p>



<p>Further, a weak rupee helped the growth
in basmati shipments to touch a new high in value terms.</p>



<p>Basmati accounted for a fourth of
India’s overall agri-product 2018-19 exports, which grew 7 per cent
in rupee value terms to touch Rs. 1.28 lakh crore from Rs. 1.19 lakh
crore in the previous year.</p>



<p>However, in dollar terms, total
agri-exports were down 1.15 per cent at $18.38 billion ($18.60
billion).</p>



<p>The dip in dollar revenues was mainly
on account of a decline in shipments of buffalo meat, non-basmati
rice and groundnut, among others.</p>



<p><strong>Non-basmati rice struggles</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Non-basmati rice shipments were hurt by
higher pricing.</p>



<p>The increase in the minimum support
price for paddy during the year impacted the competitiveness of the
grain in the world market.</p>



<p>As a result, exports registered a
17.52-per cent decline in dollar terms and 11 per cent in rupee
terms. The non-basmati volumes dropped around 14 per cent to 7.53 mt
(8.81 mt).</p>



<p>Sluggish demand from China and the
countries in the Far East impacted the shipments of buffalo meat,
which dropped to 1.23 mt (1.35 mt). In dollar terms, buffalo meat
shipments stood at $3.58 billion ($4.03 billion).</p>



<p><strong>Dairy, pulses up</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exports of dairy products jumped 76 per
cent to 1.80 lakh tonnes (1.02 lakh tonnes) after the Centre
announced incentives to ship out the surplus stocks of the skimmed
milk powder during the year.</p>



<p>In dollar terms, dairy product exports
registered 59 per cent surge in growth at $482 million.</p>



<p>Similarly, pulses exports grew 59 per
cent to exceed 2.85 lt during 2018-19. However, in value terms,
shipments were up by only 13.38 per cent on a decline in average
prices. Guar gum shipments, too, posted 4.3-per cent growth during
the year, while groundnut exports declined on account of poor offtake
from buyers such as Vietnam.</p>



<p><strong>Other products</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shipments of poultry products also grew
during the year. In dollar terms, poultry exports were up 14.54 per
cent at $98 million ($86 million). In rupee terms, the poultry
exports increased by a fourth to Rs. 687 crore ( Rs. 552 cr).</p>



<p>Though shipments of fresh fruits and
vegetables were up in volumes, the value declined by about 4 per
cent, primarily on account of a dip in per-unit pricing. Exports of
processed vegetables grew during the year, despite a drop in prices.
Processed vegetable shipments were up 12.7 per cent at Rs. 2,055
crore against Rs. 1,823 crore in the previous year. In dollar terms,
processed vegetables exports were up 4 per cent at $294 million.
However, the shipments registered a decline in value despite higher
volumes on lower pricing. Processed fruit and juice exports dropped
1.23 per cent to $639 million ($647 million).</p>



<p>Among other cereals, wheat shipments
continued to decline. Wheat exports, in volume terms, were down 43
per cent at 1.83 lakh tonnes (3.22 lakh tonnes), while in dollar
value, the shipments fell 46 per cent to $52 million ($97 million).</p>

<p>New Delhi date. Wednesday, December 2, 2020</p>



<p>Tension has not reduced even in the deadly cold on the Ladakh border between India and China. At such times, China would buy 1 lakh tonnes of rice from India. According to a news agency, India is exporting rice to china for the first time in 30 years. According to statistics, India and Thailand are the largest producers and exporters of rice in the world while China buys 4 million tonnes of rice in the world.</p>



<p>China has so far procured rice mainly from Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Pakistan. He did not buy rice from India on the pretext that the quality of India rice was not good.</p>



<p>Now, under the changed circumstances, China is attracted to buy rice from India as it is 30 per quintal cheaper than Thailand and Pakistan. It is also believed that the need to buy rice has arisen in China nowadays due to the domestic grain crisis.</p>



<p>Rice Export Association believes that in the near future, China can buy grains other than rice from India. Indian traders have also signed contracts to export 1 lakh tonnes of rice to China. 300 per tonne has been fixed for export of rice in December and February.</p>



<p>At one time not only China buy many countries in Europe were also questioning the quality of Indian rice, but India has improved the quality and there is an opportunity to export more in the rice market. India has exported 119 million tonnes of rice to various countries of the world this year, an increase of 43 per cent from 83.40 lakh last year.</p>
